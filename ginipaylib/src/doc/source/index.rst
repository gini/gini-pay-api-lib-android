Gini Pay API Library Documentation
==============================

.. note:: **Deprecation Notice**

   The Gini Pay API Library was split into industry specific API libraries: `Gini Bank API Library
   <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/bank-api-library/>`_ and `Gini Health API Library
   <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-api-library/>`_.

   This library won't be developed further and we kindly ask you to switch to one of the new libraries:

   * Gini Bank API Library
      If you have a banking related app you should switch to the Gini Bank API Library. Migration entails only a few
      steps which you can find in this `migration guide
      <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/bank-api-library/migrate-from-pay-api-lib.md>`_.
   * Gini Health API Library
      If you have a health insurance related app you should switch to the Gini Health API Library. Migration entails
      only a few steps which you can find in this `migration guide
      <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-api-library/migrate-from-pay-api-lib.md>`_.

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini Pay API Library for Android encapsulates the Gini Pay API and makes the integration into your app a
breeze.
